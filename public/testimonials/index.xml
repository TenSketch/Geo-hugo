      <description>I have took appointments regularly for tattoo removal from Mr. George himself and the results have been amazing. Continous checkup between each appointment and care guidance for cure is given after every seating. Neat and clean service is provided. Good ambience and Cost efficient as well. I would strongly recommend Geo Tattoo studio for tattoo removal and other tattoo services.</description>
